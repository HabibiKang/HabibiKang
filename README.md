I am always eager to study until I have perfected my understanding of every new concept that comes my way. This stable work-ethic of mine inspires my teammates to enjoy their work and motivates them towards producing their best work. I break down complex problems into bits of code that I am able to thoroughly dissect in order to deepen my understanding of its functionality. This allows me to rapidly debug almost any fault software I have worked towards developing in the past. From there, I begin to make use of Python's ingenuity by utilizing some of its most basic features to tighten up and debug my code. I utilize print statements; I intentionally raise value errors and play with other exception handling practices in order to ensure my code is bug free and Pythonically optimal debug without being restricted to using built-in debuggers. This is a prime example of my approach toward coding scalable software with minimalistic, linguistically simplified, Python code. In the past, my peers have told me that my code is beautiful and I take pride in those skills that I learned from Harvard's Computer Science programs (CS50P) and other free resources. My teammates of the past would often compliment my organization skills. Additionally, my mentality always prioritizes the betterment of my teammates and my group's goals. I view my part of the development process as a set of independent contributions to a collaborative strive towards optimized goal achievement.
